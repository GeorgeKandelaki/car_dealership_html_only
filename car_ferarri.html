						<p class="paragraph">
							Ferrari continues to push the boundaries of automotive performance and design with its
							latest model, the Ferrari SF90 Stradale. Introduced as Ferrari's first series-production
							plug-in hybrid, the SF90 Stradale marks a significant step forward in the evolution of the
							iconic brand. Named in honor of the 90th anniversary of Scuderia Ferrari, the company's
							racing division, the SF90 Stradale seamlessly blends advanced technology with Ferrari's
							traditional prowess.
						</p>

						<p class="paragraph">
							Under the hood, the SF90 Stradale features a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that
							produces an astounding 769 horsepower on its own. This engine is complemented by three
							electric motors, adding an additional 217 horsepower, bringing the total power output to a
							staggering 986 horsepower. The hybrid powertrain allows the SF90 Stradale to accelerate from
							0 to 60 mph in just 2.5 seconds and achieve a top speed of 211 mph. The car also offers an
							all-electric mode, capable of covering approximately 15 miles on electric power alone,
							showcasing Ferrari's commitment to reducing emissions without compromising performance.
						</p>

						<p class="paragraph">
							The design of the SF90 Stradale is both futuristic and aerodynamic, incorporating advanced
							aerodynamics to enhance downforce and stability. The car's aggressive lines, sharp angles,
							and low stance are quintessential Ferrari, reflecting the brand's racing heritage. The
							interior is equally impressive, featuring a driver-centric cockpit with a digital instrument
							cluster, a head-up display, and a state-of-the-art infotainment system. The use of
							high-quality materials such as leather, carbon fiber, and Alcantara ensures a luxurious yet
							sporty environment.
						</p>

						<p class="paragraph">
							Technologically, the SF90 Stradale is at the forefront of innovation. It includes Ferrari's
							eSSC (electric Side Slip Control) system, which integrates all dynamic controls to manage
							the car's impressive power. The hybrid system intelligently switches between electric and
							hybrid modes to optimize performance and efficiency. Additionally, the car features an
							advanced suspension system and all-wheel drive, providing exceptional handling and traction.
						</p>

						<p class="paragraph">
							The Ferrari SF90 Stradale not only represents a leap forward in terms of performance and
							technology but also symbolizes Ferrari's commitment to the future of automotive innovation.
							By integrating hybrid technology without sacrificing the driving experience that Ferrari is
							known for, the SF90 Stradale sets a new benchmark for supercars. It embodies Ferrari's
							vision of combining sustainability with unparalleled performance, making it a remarkable
							addition to the storied legacy of the Prancing Horse.
